Component:( A component is a small setion of code that can include javascript and html)

- A component is a self contained section of code that functions as a reusable building block.
- function based components pay attention to capitalization of component name 
- end of the file export the component, it could be import else where 
- inside the function we can return something return(pure HTMl);
- within our return statements we can insert some js using {}
- outside the return statements we dont need {we cna js  methods too} to use js codes
- react components only capable of creating of single element can have mutiple children element.
- return statements are designed only to return one component at a time.
- jsx element must be wrapped in an enclosing tag <></>
- we can reusing the component if we would like .
